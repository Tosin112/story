For someone who always seems to get bored, I have never been more entertained than when staring into the empty night sky
looking at the freedom the stars have and just how peaceful it is, how beautiful it is. It doesn't need to let you know it doesn;t
need your attention. It just reveals itself to only those who look up to it.
